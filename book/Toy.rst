A toy project for learning Low*
===============================

In ``tutorial/``, a complete Low* project with Makefile, specs, spec tests, Low*
implementation and C tests is provided for your enjoyment. The project is about
writing a toy bignum implementation -- addition is already written and the rest
is up for you to complete.

This is by far the most comprehensive example so far, and contains some
exercises left as comments at the bottom of the various. There are numerous
comments about what is the preferred style.
